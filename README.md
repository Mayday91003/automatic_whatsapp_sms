This Python code uses the `pywhatkit` library to send a WhatsApp message at a specified time. Here's a short explanation:

### Importing the `pywhatkit` module
```python
import pywhatkit
```

Explanation:
- `pywhatkit`: This is a Python library that provides various functions to interact with WhatsApp.

### Sending a WhatsApp message at a specified time
```python
pywhatkit.sendwhatmsg("+880 ****-*******", "hi there.", 1, 14)
```

Explanation:
- `pywhatkit.sendwhatmsg()`: This function is used to send a WhatsApp message.
- `"+880 ****-*******"`: This is the phone number to which the message will be sent. Replace it with the actual recipient's phone number.
- `"hi there."`: This is the message content. Change it as needed.
- `1`: This is the hour when the message will be sent (24-hour format). In this case, it's set to 1.
- `14`: This is the minute when the message will be sent. In this case, it's set to 14.

Make sure to replace the phone number with the recipient's actual number and customize the message and time as per your requirements. Additionally, the `pywhatkit` library requires that you have WhatsApp Web open on the device where this script is running for the message to be sent successfully.
